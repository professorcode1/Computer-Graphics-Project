<h1>Flight Simulator Over Procedurally Generated Terrain</h1>
<br><br>
This is my project for my Computer Graphics Course. It uses a compute shader to create a terrain from simplex noise. The parameters can be changed from the parameters.json file. Here's a screenshot of the terrain with global illumination from the sun.

Here's what it looks like playing.

To use, git pull this project. In the project folder download and put the glm source code folder as well. Then use the make command.
