# Marching Cubes 
I have implimented the marching cubes algorithm to get a mesh from the formula(firstDump files being the results at different parameters). But
<li> It is running on the CPU so even multi-threaded its extremely slow.
<li> The results are somewhat good. But not as good. It looks extremely artificial.

I am gonna impliment it on the GPU using geometry shaders now. I will use texture memory to store the data required.
